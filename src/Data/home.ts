    researchAgenda: `As recent advancements within AI continue to transform the 
      capabilities of edge devices, they present unique challenges and opportunities 
      in computing. My research agenda is dedicated to pioneering advanced AI models 
      that are not only generalizable and interpretable but also reliable enough for
      critical medical applications. A key aspect of my research agenda is to improve
      the affordability and accuracy of medical devices, with the ultimate goal of
      making these technologies accessible in underprivileged regions worldwide. 
      While my primary interest is in healthcare, I also possess a keen curiosity
      in autonomous vehicle technologies. <br><br>

    secondTitle:'Short Biography',
    aboutMe: `<p>I am a Senior Assessment Developer at <a href="https://workera.ai/">Workera.ai</a>, specializing in Data 
    and AI. I have been a part of Workera family from July 2021. Since December 2023, I have also been collaborating with 
    <a href="https://www.nsaquib.org/https://www.nsaquib.org/">Nazmus Saquib</a>, 
    PhD from MIT Media Lab, as a Research Assistant, working 
    on novel methods to represent AI models through the embodied representation of differential 
    equations to enhance model interpretability.<br><br></p>

    <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from 
    <a href="https://www.cuet.ac.bd/">Chittagong University of Engineering 
    and Technology</a>, where I had the privilege of conducting research under the supervision of Professor
     <a href = "https://www.cuet.ac.bd/members/501">Md. Mokammel Haque</a>. Under Professor Haque's 
     supervision, my academic focus included research on 
     improving communication and accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals through image segmentation 
     and object detection techniques, alongside tackling the critical healthcare challenge of diagnosing pyrexia. 
     Post-graduation, from 2021 to 2022, I continued my research collaboration with Professor Haque while 
     simultaneously fulfilling my professional duties at Workera.<br><br></p>

    <p>In addition to my primary roles, I have been an Adjunct Lecturer at 
    <a href = "https://www.eastdelta.edu.bd/">East Delta University</a> since September 2023, 
    instructing courses in Mobile Computing, Digital Electronics and Pulse Techniques, Compiler Theory, and Computer 
    Graphics. From April 2024, I have been a Specialized Trainer at the 
    <a href = "https://skitbi-cuet.com/courses/ai-machine-learning-with-python-batch-2/">Sheikh Kamal IT Business Incubator</a> 
    under the Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority, delivering training in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.<br><br></p>

    <p>My interest in Machine Learning began in 2019 during my third year of university. Since then, 
    I have pursued numerous online and offline courses in the field. In 2020, during my final year of undergraduate, I collaborated 
    with small research groups to study the use of Generative Adversarial Networks to enhance the diagnostic process for 
    skin diseases through synthetic data generation. That same year, I led Team OkkhorNama to become one of the final 
    25 teams in the National AI Bangla Competition, selected from a pool of 800 teams. Our project, aimed at aiding 
    hearing-impaired individuals, was recognized for its innovative approach, and the dataset we developed was later
     endorsed and utilized for further development in a government project.</p>`
