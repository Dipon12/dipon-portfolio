    researchAgenda: `
    <p>My research agenda is dedicated to pioneering advanced AI models that are not only generalizable and interpretable, but also reliable enough for high-stakes applications. A key aim of my future research involves developing mathematically optimized AI models, with the broader objective of making them accessible for application in underserved regions globally. While my primary interest is healthcare, I am also very keen about robotics and other autonomous technologies. <br><br>

    aboutMe: `
    <p>I am a Senior Assessment Developer at <a href="https://workera.ai/">Workera.ai</a>, specializing in Data and AI. I have been a part of the Workera family from July 2021. During this time, I had the opportunity to work under the direct guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kiankatan/">Kian Katanforoosh</a>, contributing to the design and development of signature AI assessments across key domains.
         
    
    From December 2023 to Fabruary 2025, I have collaborated with <a href="https://www.nsaquib.org/https://www.nsaquib.org/">Nazmus Saquib</a>, PhD from MIT Media Lab, as a Research Assistant, working on novel methods to solve differential equation through the embodied representation of differential equations to enhance model interpretability. 
    
    In April 2025, I joined Universal Machine as a Software Engineer - II to develop AI-powered financial agents that enables intelligent cryptocurrency trading and investment decision-making. I built AI agents using OpenAI models that parse natural language investment strategies, integrate with blockchain systems through MCP servers for real-time market data processing, and autonomously execute trading decisions while maintaining seamless communication between AI models and cryptocurrency APIs.<br><br></p>

    <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.cuet.ac.bd/">Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology</a>, graduating in June 2021, where I had the privilege of conducting research under the supervision of Professor <a href = "https://www.cuet.ac.bd/members/501">Md. Mokammel Haque</a>. Under Professor Haque's supervision, my academic focus included research on improving communication and accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals through image segmentation and object detection techniques, alongside tackling the critical healthcare challenge of diagnosing pyrexia. Post-graduation, from 2021 to 2022, I continued my research collaboration with Professor Haque while simultaneously fulfilling my professional duties at Workera.<br><br></p>

    <p>In addition to my primary roles, I have been an Adjunct Lecturer at <a href = "https://www.eastdelta.edu.bd/">East Delta University</a> since September 2023, instructing courses in Mobile Computing and Applications, Digital Electronics and Pulse Techniques, Compiler Theory, and Computer Graphics. From April 2024, I have been a Specialized Trainer at the 
    <a href = "https://skitbi-cuet.com/courses/ai-machine-learning-with-python-batch-2/">IT Business Incubator</a> under the Bangladesh Hi-Tech Park Authority, delivering training in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.<br><br></p>

    <p>My interest in Machine Learning began in 2019 during my third year of university. Since then, 
    I have pursued numerous <a href="/education#Online-Courses">online and offline courses</a> in the field. In 2020, during my final year of undergraduate, I collaborated with small research groups to study the use of Generative Adversarial Networks to enhance the diagnostic process for skin diseases through synthetic data generation. That same year, I led Team OkkhorNama to become one of the final 25 teams in the <a href = "https://bangla.gov.bd/ai-for-bangla-1-0/">National AI for Bangla Competition</a>, selected from a pool of 800 teams. Our project, aimed at aiding hearing-impaired individuals, was recognized for its innovative approach, and the dataset we developed was later endorsed and utilized for further development in a government project.</p>`
